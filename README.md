# DoggoDec17
## About Project:
Reiteration of [DoggoDec16](https://github.com/mittons/DoggoDec16) and [DoggoDisplay01](https://github.com/mittons/DoggoDisplay01). Done mostly to practice individual code elements, syntax, larger patterns and understanding of the functional elements of both fine-grained operations as well higher level interactions between components.

Most of it was written from memory and understanding. A few small bits were copied directly from either of the projects mentioned.

Uses data from [TheDogApi.com](https://thedogapi.com/).

Uses [DoggoDec17](https://github.com/mittons/DoggoDec17) as a mock image for testing.

Managed to finish this within the day this time around !! ^.^

If I am gonna publish projects at some frequency then I should probably create a separate account for one-off skill considation/refining project like this,[MockDogApiDec16](https://github.com/mittons/MockDogApi16), [DoggoDec16](https://github.com/mittons/DoggoDec16) and [MockDogApiDec17](https://github.com/mittons/MockDogApiDec17).

## Notable (Milestone) Resources Created:
- Skill consolidation.
